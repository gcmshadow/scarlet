Regression Testing
------------------

This section contains interactive plots to track the accuracy of scarlet on a collection of blends.
Each blend is taken from the HSC-COSMOS deep patch 9813 with a fake source injected.
This section is mostly for developers but may also be of interest to researchers curious about the current
performance of scarlet.

* Dataset 1 contains 100 blends that are all modeled well by scarlet, to ensure that we continue to model them well
* Dataset 2 contains 50 randomly selected blends from a single patch of HSC data
* Dataset 3 contains 14 blends selected by hand to include different types of blends of varying degree of difficulty.
