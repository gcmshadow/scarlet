Diagnostics
-----------

During the development of scarlet there are a number of algorithms and/or
approximations being used. This section aims to provide users with useful information
about any biases or limitations of the algorithms used in scarlet. It will also act
as a defacto testing suite that is built with new commits to ensure that the new features
are not broken. In time the diagnostics included in this section may be modified or removed.
