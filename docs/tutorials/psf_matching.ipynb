    "# Matching PSF's\n",
    "\n",
    "Because images taken at different times in different bands will have widely varying PSF's, it is often necessary to convolve the images to a common PSF to ensure that every source has the same morphology in each band.\n",
    "One way to solve this problem is to created PSF matched co-adds that are passed to *SCARLET* as input images.\n",
    "The drawback to this solution is that bands with smaller PSFs are likely to have less blending, which is better for constraining their shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed to show how to create a model that uses a different PSF in each band, including showing one way to create difference kernels using *SCARLET* and illustrating why partially deconvolving using difference kernels is the correct way to approach this problem."
